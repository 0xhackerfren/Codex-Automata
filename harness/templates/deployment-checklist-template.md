# Deployment Checklist: [Release / Version]

<!--
[Use this template during Phase 7 (Deployment and Observation) to verify readiness, execute deployment, and confirm success. Deployment executes through the CI/CD pipeline designed at architecture time (Pipeline as First Citizen, Principle 12). Every item must be checked before proceeding to the next section.]

### Review and Approval

- [ ] Human review approved for all modules in this release
- [ ] Interface contracts frozen and verified
- [ ] Specification changes documented and approved
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated
- [ ] Release tagged in version control following project tagging convention (R18)
- [ ] Context state file reflects deployment-ready status

### Environment Readiness

- [ ] Target environment is accessible and healthy
- [ ] Configuration values verified for target environment
- [ ] Database migrations prepared and tested (if applicable)
- [ ] Feature flags configured (if applicable)
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting active for target environment

## Deployment Steps

1. [ ] _[Step 1: e.g., "Run database migrations"]_
2. [ ] _[Step 2: e.g., "Deploy backend services"]_
3. [ ] _[Step 3: e.g., "Deploy frontend"]_
4. [ ] _[Step 4: e.g., "Enable feature flags"]_

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Smoke Tests

- [ ] Core user journey works (manual or automated)
- [ ] Critical API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Authentication flow works
- [ ] Data integrity verified

### Monitoring

- [ ] Error rates within normal bounds
- [ ] Response times within SLO
- [ ] No unexpected log patterns
- [ ] Resource utilization within expected range

## Rollback Plan

**Trigger criteria:** _[What conditions trigger a rollback? e.g., "Error rate exceeds 5% for 5 minutes"]_

**Rollback steps:**
1. [ ] _[Step 1]_
2. [ ] _[Step 2]_

**Rollback verification:**
- [ ] Smoke tests pass on rolled-back version
- [ ] Monitoring confirms recovery

## Post-Deployment Notes
